Hey y'all, I'm Imire, a Software Engineer at Andela in Nairobi, Kenya. Born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya I worked on my first project way back in 2014 as I was finishing up my final year project. I used the LAMP stack. After finishing campus, I ditched coding and did Systems Administration in some of the local companies here in Kenya untill 2018 where I decide to get back to coding. Went through a vigorous bootcamp in Andela and finally joined the company in September 2018. So far I've been able to work for Voyage Control, a logistics management company based in London for a year.

In my spare time I work on my personal projects trying to perfect my art. I play video games and also watch some Netflix documentaries.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning DevOps particulary CI/CD with CircleCi and also deploying docker containers in kubernetes clusters. I'm also learning mobile development using React Native and serverless technologies like Amplify.

âš¡ Fun fact: My perfect weekend will be hanging out with my peers playing FIFA
